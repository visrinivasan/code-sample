It generates Fibonacci series F(n) for first n numbers.
n is kept 10, but can be varied as the user demands.

For F(n), it prints
* "Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
* "Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
* "FizzBuzz" when F(n) is divisible by 15.
* "BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
* the value F(n) otherwise.
